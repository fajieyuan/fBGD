 fBGD: A Unified Batch Gradient Approach for Positive Unlabeled Learning

You can run FBGD_MF, which is batch gradient descent (BGD) for basic dot product or run FBGD_SVDFeature, which is BGD for SVDFeature. fBGD can be applied in fields where there are a small portion of positive examples and a large portion of negative or unlabeled examples, such image/document classification, DNA representation, CTR prediction, query autocompletion,recommendation, word embedding...
